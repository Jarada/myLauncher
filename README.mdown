Adding myLauncher to your iPhone App
====================================

These steps assume you understand the basics of iOS application development.
Follow the following steps in order to add myLauncher into your project:

1. Clone the myLauncher repository: 'git clone git://github.com/Jarada/mylauncher.git'

2. Locate the MyLauncher folder under '../myLauncher/myLauncher/Classes/' 
	* Copy the MyLauncher folder into your project folder.
 	* Import all the files within that folder into your Xcode project.

3. Locate the RootViewController files under '../myLauncher/myLauncher/'
	* Copy RootViewController.h and RootViewController.m into your project folder
	* Import both files into your Xcode project.

4. In your application delegate header file make the following changes (AppDelegate.h):
	* Import the RootViewController header file:
		
		import "RootViewController.h"
		
5. In your application delegate implementation file make the following changes (AppDelegate.m):	
	* Inside applicationDidFinishLaunching modify your UINavigationController to initialize with RootViewController:
		
		navigationController = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:[[[RootViewController alloc] init] autorelease]];
		
6. In your prefix file make the following changes (AppName_Prefix.pch):	
	* Outside the ifdef define the shortcut for color:
	
		define COLOR(r,g,b) [UIColor colorWithRed:r/255.0 green:g/255.0 blue:b/255.0 alpha:1]
		
7. In your RootViewController (RootViewController.m):
	* Import your view controllers before the @implementation block, for example:
	
		import "ItemViewController.h"
		
	* In the loadView method add your ItemViewController into appControllers:
	
		[appControllers setObject:[ItemViewController class] forKey:@"ItemViewController"];
		
	* Adjust the rest of this method to fill in the appropriate icons and settings
	
8. IMPORTANT: You will need to make the necessary changes inside the application delegate and RootViewController in order to have the correct icons and in order to load the correct view controllers.
